## Description

Welcome! This is **Craftify**, an AI-Powered Production Planner designed for craftsmen, artists, and small-scale manufacturers. This project focuses on **UI/UX design** to demonstrate how a production planner can streamline order management, scheduling, inventory tracking, and client communication. All interactions, dashboards, and workflows are designed as **interactive prototypes and wireframes** to visualize efficient production processes without actual coding.  

## Design Tools Used

- Figma (for high-fidelity prototypes)  
- Balsamiq (for low-fidelity wireframes)  

## Features

1. **Dashboard:**
   - Overview of active orders, deadlines, inventory, and task progress.
   - Visual representation of profitability and production timelines.
    
2. **Order Management:**
   - Input, track, and prioritize orders visually.
   - Mockups for client details, deadlines, and specifications.
    
3. **Schedule:**
   - Interactive calendar showing tasks, milestones, and completed work.
   - Color-coded activities for easy understanding of production flow.
    
4. **Materials & Inventory:**
   - Inventory tracking and low-stock alerts in wireframes.
   - Visual representation of material usage and restock notifications.
    
5. **Inbox:**
   - Messaging interface for client communication.
   - Mockups for past and ongoing conversations.
    
6. **Settings:**
   - Customization options for notifications, appearance, and user preferences.
   - Privacy, help, and support screens visualized in UI mockups.
    
7. **AI-Driven Production Scheduling (Conceptual):**
   - Timelines optimized for deadlines and resources.
   - Visual representation of dynamic rescheduling and priority alerts.
