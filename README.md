## Project Overview

The AI Production Planner is a conceptual tool designed to meet the operational needs of craftsmen who manage multiple projects, materials, and client orders. By focusing on **user-centered UI/UX design**, the system concept illustrates how:  

- Production schedules can be efficiently visualized and managed  
- Orders and deadlines can be tracked clearly  
- Inventory and materials can be monitored  
- Tasks and resources can be allocated intuitively  
- Client communication can be streamlined  

The project emphasizes **ease of use, visual clarity, and workflow optimization** for users with varying technical skills.
